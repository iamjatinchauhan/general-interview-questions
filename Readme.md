# Interview Guide
The key to an interview is to tell a story. Relate it to your personal vision and to what you can do for them. Help them understand that as you learn, your vision will adjust, and you really want to work with them toward a common vision.  


You are using the interviewer’s time. Don’t make this a boring meeting. **Bring the energy and have a two way conversation with them.** They don’t want to be sitting with a scared interviewer that is low energy and can’t hold a conversation without questions.  

Prepare a final closing argument. However, the first and last impressions are what most interviewers remember. **Start the first interaction with high energy and politeness.** At the end, no matter how well the interview goes, conclude with something that touches all of these points:

+ Don’t overuse the word “I”
+ Talk about the interviewer
+ Express to them how much better you are than everyone else but don’t brag

Here is an example:
```
Well thank you for your time. I am sure you have lots of candidates to see, but I wanted to say one last thing: 
There are no shortages of developers for you to interview. However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless, developers with ambition to learn. 
The best developers aren’t the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders. 
It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong. 
I may not be the most experienced developer that you will interview, but the one thing that you can guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview 
that will work as hard to develop his/her skills every day, play nicely with other developers, and isn’t so narrow minded in problem solving that he/she isn’t willing to try new novel ideas. 
When you hire me you will rest assured that you won’t have to micromanage me, you don’t have to extinguish fires, and in one year, I will be one of your most valuable employees. 
I am at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can grow with and I have chosen <Company Name> for this specific reason. 
You have probably had similar experience in your career when one company allowed you to really have an impact. 
I am at that stage now, and I look forward to be part of this team. 

Thank you.
```

Write an email afterwards to the people who have interviewed you. Thank them, and if there were any technical challenges that you couldn’t answer during the interview, reply and let them know that you have looked at the problem and this is the solution (hopefully you were able to figure it out by this point in the comfort of your home and google). Ask them in this letter when you should expect an answer.


### Q. Tell me about yourself.
**What They Want to Know:** The interviewer wants to know why you're an excellent fit for the job. Try to answer questions about yourself without giving too much, or too little, personal information. You can start by sharing some of your personal interests and experiences that don't relate directly to work, such as a favorite hobby or a brief account of where you grew up, your education and what motivates you. You can even share some fun facts and showcase your personality to make the interview a little more interesting.


### Q. Why should we hire you?
```

Be specific about what makes you a good fit for this role, and mention aspects of the company and position that appeal to you most.


### Q. Prove your worth to me!
**What They Want to Know:** Sometimes, an Interviewer is not looking for a fixed answer; but they are looking for sensible answer to just know how deep you can think.
```

My worth for your Company doesn't exist at this moment, it's zero, give me the <job position> and I promise I will build my worth with dedication, commitment and hardwork and then an experienced professional like you can analyse my contributions to this esteemed company and worth in the annual performance review.

When customers or associates come to me with issues, I try to look at things from their perspective, and initiate a collaborative problem-solving approach to keep the situation from escalating. 
I find that maintaining an efficient, congenial office with open lines of communication automatically reduces a lot of workplace stress. Of course, sometimes unanticipated stressors will arise. 
When this happens, I just take a deep breath, remembering that the person I’m dealing with is frustrated with a situation, not with me. 
I then actively listen to their concerns and make a plan to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. 
```
**What They Want to Know:** What do you do when things don’t go smoothly at work? How do you deal with difficult situations? The employer wants to know how you handle workplace stress.

### Q. Describe a difficult work situation or project and how you overcame it?
