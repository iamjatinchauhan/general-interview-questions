# Some Behavioural Interview Questions

Behavioural interview questions require candidates to share examples of specific situations they’ve been in where they had to use certain skills.  

**Here are four steps to answering using this technique:**

**(S) Situation.** Describe the situation in which the event took place.  
**(T) Task.** Describe the task you were asked to complete. If there was a particular problem or issue you were trying to solve, describe that here.  
**(A) Action.** Explain what action you took to complete the task or solve the problem.  
**(R) Results.** Explain the result of your actions. For example, if your actions resulted in completing a task, resolving a conflict, improving your company’s sales record etc. explain this. Try to focus on how your actions resulted in a success for the company.  

## Teamwork

For questions like these, you want a story that illustrates your ability to work with others under challenging circumstances. Think team conflict, difficult project constraints, or clashing personalities.

1. Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.
2. Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?
3. Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?
4. We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you’d handled a situation differently with a colleague.
5. Tell me about a time you needed to get information from someone who wasn’t very responsive. What did you do?

## Client-facing Skills

If the role you’re interviewing for works with clients, definitely be ready for one of these. Find an example of a time where you successfully represented your company or team and delivered exceptional customer service.

1. Describe a time when it was especially important to make a good impression on a client. How did you go about doing so?
2. Give me an example of a time when you did not meet a client’s expectation. What happened, and how did you attempt to rectify the situation?
3. Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.
4. Describe a time when you had to interact with a difficult client. What was the situation, and how did you handle it?
5. When you’re working with a large number of customers, it’s tricky to deliver excellent service to them all. How do you go about prioritizing your customers’ needs?

## Ability to Adapt

Times of turmoil are finally good for something! Think of a recent work crisis you successfully navigated. Even if your navigation didn’t feel successful at the time, find a lesson or silver lining you took from the situation.

1. Tell me about a time you were under a lot of pressure. What was going on, and how did you get through it?
2. Describe a time when your team or company was undergoing some change. How did that impact you, and how did you adapt?
3. Tell me about the first job you’ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?
4. Give me an example of a time when you had to think on your feet in order to delicately extricate yourself from a difficult or awkward situation.
5. Tell me about a time you failed. How did you deal with the situation?

## Time Management Skills

In other words, get ready to talk about a time you juggled multiple responsibilities, organized it all (perfectly), and completed everything before the deadline.

1. Tell me about a time you had to be very strategic in order to meet all your top priorities.
2. Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?
3. Sometimes it’s just not possible to get everything on your to-do list done. Tell me about a time your responsibilities got a little overwhelming. What did you do?
4. Tell me about a time you set a goal for yourself. How did you go about ensuring that you would meet your objective?
5. Give me an example of a time you managed numerous responsibilities. How did you handle that?

## Communication Skills

You probably won’t have any trouble thinking of a story for communication questions, since it’s not only part of most jobs; it’s part of everyday life. However, the thing to remember here is to also talk about your thought process or preparation.

1. Give me an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade someone to see things your way at work.
2. Describe a time when you were the resident technical expert. What did you do to make sure everyone was able to understand you?
3. Tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to get your ideas across to your team.
4. Give me an example of a time when you had to explain something fairly complex to a frustrated client. How did you handle this delicate situation?
5. Tell me about a successful presentation you gave and why you think it was a hit.

## Motivation and Values

A lot of seemingly random interview questions are actually attempts to learn more about what motivates you. Your response would ideally address this directly even if the question wasn’t explicit about it.

1. Tell me about your proudest professional accomplishment.
2. Describe a time when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
3. Tell me about a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision. How did you handle that?
4. Give me an example of a time you were able to be creative with your work. What was exciting or difficult about it?
5. Tell me about a time you were dissatisfied in your work. What could have been done to make it better?

## Tips for Answering Behavioural Interview Questions

**Take Your Time.** It’s okay to take a moment before answering the question. Take a breath, or a sip of water, or simply pause. This will give you time to calm any nerves and think of an anecdote that appropriately answers the question.

**Prepare Ahead of Time.** Review common behavioural interview questions ahead of time and practice your answers.

**Follow the STAR Technique.** Be sure to answer any questions using the STAR technique described above. By completing each of the four steps, you will provide a thorough answer without rambling or getting off topic.

**Be Positive.** Often, behavioural interview questions require you to focus on a problem or a failure at work. Describe the problem or issue you faced, but don’t focus too much on the negative. Quickly shift to describing how you solved the problem and the positive results.

## Extras from some source

### Questions About Problem-Solving

**What They Want to Know:** These questions are intended to discover the analytical thought processes you use to problem-solve.  

Focus on explaining, in detail, the steps you took to resolve a challenging work issue in the past.

+ Give an example of an occasion when you used logic to solve a problem.
+ How do you handle a challenge?
+ Did you ever make a risky decision? Why? How did you handle it?
+ Give an example of a goal you reached and tell me how you achieved it.
+ Given an example of a goal you didn’t meet and how you handled it.
+ When you worked on multiple projects, how did you prioritize?
+ Give an example of how you set goals and achieve them.

### Questions About Teamwork

**What They Want to Know:** When a hiring manager asks questions about teamwork, this is usually because good teamwork and collaboration skills are essential to doing the job you’re applying for effectively and efficiently. Be prepared to demonstrate how you have successfully been both a team leader and a team member or follower.  

+ Have you ever dealt with company policy you weren’t in agreement with? How?
+ Have you gone above and beyond the call of duty? If so, how?
+ Have you had to convince a team to work on a project they weren’t thrilled about? How did you do it?
+ Give an example of how you’ve worked on a team.
+ Have you handled a difficult situation with a co-worker? How?
+ What do you do if you disagree with a co-worker?
+ Share an example of how you were able to motivate employees or co-workers.
+ What do you do if you disagree with your boss?

### Questions About Stress

**What They Want to Know:** Like questions about teamwork, questions about how you handle stress are a good clue about the work climate you would be walking into should you land the job. Be honest in describing how you’ve dealt with pressure before in the course of your career.  

+ Describe a stressful situation at work and how you handled it.
+ Tell me about how you worked effectively under pressure.
+ Describe a decision you made that was unpopular and how you handled implementing it.
+ How did you handle meeting a tight deadline?
+ What do you do when your schedule is interrupted? Give an example of how you handle it.
+ Have you handled a difficult situation with a supervisor? How?
+ Have you handled a difficult situation with another department? How?
+ Have you handled a difficult situation with a client or vendor? How?

### Questions About Self-Knowledge

**What They Want to Know:** These questions are sometimes “trick” questions – how you answer them is as important as what you actually say. The hiring manager is interested in how you view your own strengths and weaknesses and how you have remedied mistakes you or others made in the past.  

The best strategy is to own up to former errors, but then to show how you made a path correction and ultimately learned something from the experience.

+ Have you been in a situation where you didn’t have enough work to do?
+ Have you ever made a mistake? How did you handle it?
+ Did you ever postpone making a decision? Why?
+ Did you ever not meet your goals? Why?
+ Do you listen? Give an example of when you did or when you didn’t listen.
